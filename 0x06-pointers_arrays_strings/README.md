This tests 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings for alx low level engineering
0. strcat a function that concatenates two strings.
1. strncat a function that concatenates two strings.it will use at most n bytes from src; and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytesReturn a pointer to the resulting string dest
2. strncpy a function that copies a string.



Prototype: char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);
3. strcmp -function that compares two strings Your function should work exactly like strcmp
4-rev_array.c -a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
5-string_toupper.c -  a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
6-cap_string.c -a function that capitalizes all words of a string.; Prototype: char *cap_string(char *);Separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and }
7-leet.c - a function that encodes a string into 1337.
